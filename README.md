# Axle-admin
# React + Vite

This is the code for the admin panel of the Asphalt-Axle project

Using the admin panel, products and their descriptions and prices can be added to the database or products can 
be removed from the database as well. There is also a tab to show all the products in the database as well.

The Admin pannel runs on Vite

### Run

To run this admin panel, download all the files from this repository and open the folder where the files are store
on your local computer from vs code or another editor and open the terminal. If the terminal is not already in the admin folder,
navigate to the admin folder and run the command "npm run dev" to open the admin pannel on your default browser

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
